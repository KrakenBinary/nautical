# SurfForecastScraper

A python based web scraper to grab the surf forecast from [Swellinfo](https://www.swellinfo.com).
The intention is to move this over to Amazon's Alexa inside of a skill. I would like 
to be able to ask Alexa [in my house] what the surf forecast for the area is, so that 
I can make a decision before I try to go surfing. 

This would be easy enough to just program my current location into the Alexa skill, and
query only the information from that page. I decided that I wanted to expand upon the 
specific use case, and I would like to create a generic Alexa skill to let me query
multiple surf locations for their forecast.
